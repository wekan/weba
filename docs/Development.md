# WeBa development

The Gambas application project is `WeKan/`. When this checkout is under a
WeKan workspace, shared repository instructions live in that workspace's root
`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Project-specific development information lives here
and in the [README](../README.md), rather than in duplicate instruction files.

## Source map

| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| Login and registration | `WeKan/.src/WebformLogin.class` and `.webform` |
| Native navigation and editors | `WeKan/.src/WebformMain.class` and `.webform` |
| Accounts, sessions and connection | `WeKan/.src/WebDatabase.module`, `WebIdentity.module`, `ApiTokens.module` |
| Board/card persistence and permissions | `KanbanStore.module`, `BoardAccess.module`, `ApiMemberRoles.module` |
| REST routing and projections | `RestApi.module`, `BoardRestData.module` |
| UTC card dates and change clocks | `CardDates.module`, `ItemChanges.module` |
| Workspace menus, transfer and rich content | `WorkspaceStore.module`, `WorkspaceActions.module`, `BoardTransfer.module`, `CardContent.module` |
| Embedded report components | `WeKan/.public/kanban.js`, `kanban.css`, `ui.js` |
| Local CGI host | `runtime/server.py` |
| Build, checks and packaging | `build.sh`, `tests/`, `releases/`, `.github/workflows/` |

`TODO.md` records completed verification, current work and remaining parity gaps.
The two project changelogs are `CHANGELOG.md` (Upcoming plain bullets) and
`WeKan/.hidden/CHANGELOG` (dated Gambas entries). Generated output belongs in
ignored locations such as `dist/`; no runtime user database belongs in a package.

## Gambas tools

`build.sh` discovers a standalone `.tools/` or the containing workspace's tools
directory. `WEBA_TOOLS_DIR` selects it explicitly. The preferred installation is
`bin/gambas`, with the earlier `bin/gambas3` layout as a fallback.
`GAMBAS_PREFIX` selects a relocated installation; `GAMBAS_ROOT` supplies the
compiler's `-r` prefix. Executable overrides are `GBC`, `GBX`, `GBA`, `GBR` and
`NODE`. Relocated runtimes may also need `GB_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Use `./build.sh doctor` to inspect the toolchain and `./build.sh test` for local
checks. The build uses one compiler job (`gbc3 -j 1 -a WeKan`). The menu's
**Copy Gambas to Flatpak Sandbox** copies the host tools/components/dependencies;
CPU and libc compatibility still require verification. See the README's build,
Flatpak and packaging sections for the current commands and target limitations.

Create repository-local `.tools/tmp` and export its absolute path as `TMPDIR`
before compilers/test runners. Tests create isolated projects/databases there;
never point a test at deployed data. A passing local SQLite/Linux ARM64 run does
not establish support for every writable Gambas driver or release platform.

## Persistence and verification details

SQLite is the tested default. Production schema uses Gambas `Connection.Tables`
and field/primary-key APIs; data uses bound parameters, portable operations and
`DatabaseTransactions`. SQLite-specific triggers/DDL in isolated tests inject
failures and are not production migrations. Driver components and independent
conformance are needed before claiming another database is verified.

`Crypt.Check` returns True on a mismatch. Authentication checks must cover both
password outcomes; first registration, optional length policy and stored session
versions have dedicated tests. Native cookies and Bearer tokens are separate.

`ItemChanges.Mark` is an internal hook called only after the owning mutation has
authorized its operation. Its clocks must share that mutation's transaction.
Whole-board clock reads require full-card scope. Use `Collection.Add` when a
wire object must retain a typed empty string: indexed assignment removes it,
and Gambas 3.20 `JSONCollection._put` converts it to null.

The HTTP tests run source and packaged paths. `WEKAN_SOURCE` can select a
reference checkout for unchanged original callbacks/helper comparisons; absent
reference checks report a skip. Those partial checks and Chromium workflows do
not establish that the complete original UI/API/security suites pass. See the
README and TODO for the exact current coverage and remaining work.

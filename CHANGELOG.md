# Upcoming WeKan ® for Gambas release

This work adds the following features and fixes:

- Added registration without seeded accounts: the first successful registration
  becomes Admin and later registrations become Normal, including concurrent
  first registrations. Create the SQLite schema on first use and stop shipping
  the demo database. Thanks to xet7.
- Fixed recursive/swallowed permission checks, hash new passwords, authorize
  resets against the actual session, preserve password whitespace and avoid
  logging password hashes. Added isolated authentication, permission and
  concurrent-registration regression tests. Thanks to xet7.

- Added native Gambas board/card navigation and editing, persistent owner-scoped
  boards/cards, search, labels, assignees, swimlanes, due dates, archives and
  activity records, with portable Gambas driver operations. SQLite is verified;
  other drivers still require conformance testing. Thanks to xet7.
- Added local HTML/JavaScript/CSS lists, swimlanes, tables, monthly calendars,
  due-date milestones and current-status charts inside Gambas. Added profile/
  password and administrator user-management controls, SQLite CRUD/negative tests
  and DOM/report tests. Full current WeKan parity remains in TODO.md.
  Thanks to xet7.
